# challengames-ui-vuejs

## Description
UI exploiting an API that has been designed in order to give the possibility to a group of friends to dare each other on succeeding challenges on their favourite games, and keep track of results of the latter challenges. The well-known piece of paper used usually is often lost and isn't really adequate to keep long term scores of challenges between friends. Challenges is composed of a simple description as well as the game of interest. A challenge's description could be for example: "Gather a certain number of coins x in the level l of Mario 64 under a certain amount of time t". After defining a challenge, it is sent to a contestant that can either accept or refuse it. After the challenge being performed by the contestant, the challenger is then able to define if the challenge was a success or a failure.
